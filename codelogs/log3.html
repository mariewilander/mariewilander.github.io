    <h1>How does a CSS media query work?</h1>
    <p>
        CSS media queries are used to change the appearance and behavior of a website or app. They can be used
        with HTML and Javascript, but are more commonly associated with CSS. They go in a stylesheet using an
        <code>@media</code> and defines characteristics of the webpage
        within rules such as how big and how small the screen needs to be for the rule to apply, the resolution, for
        print, etc.
    </p>

    <h1>Why are CSS media queries useful?</h1>
    <p>
        CSS media queries are useful when you're designing a responsive website that adapts to different layouts that
        changes with the size of the screen the webpage is viewed on.
        It keeps your website useful whether the user is viewing it on a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, landscape or
        portrait. No matter how the viewer sees your website,
        the design is intentional and readable for the person on your website. The use of media queries enhances
        accessibility, allowing the website to adapt to specific needs.
        Lastly, the use of media queries applies different capabilities based on the device being used. The website can
        detect whether the user is using a mouse or a touchscreen
        and act accordingly.
    </p>

    <h1>Media features supported by media queries-and what they do.</h1>
    <h2>Width</h2>
    <p>
        A width media query in CSS applies styles specified in the stylesheet based on the width of the user's viewport,
        or device. You can use <code>min-width or max-width</code>
        to define breakpoints in the layout of your webpage.
    </p>

    <h2>Orientation</h2>
    <p>
        The orientation media query in CSS applies styles based on whether the browser window of the user is in
        landscape or portrait mode, such as when someone's using a laptop
        versus a phone.
    </p>

    <h2>Display-mode</h2>
    <p>
        The display-mode media query applies styles based on how the website is displayed, whether that's in a browser
        tab, in an app, without the browser bar, fullscreen, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Resolution</h2>
    <p>
        The resolution media query applies styles based on the pixel density of the device being used. This allows the
        web designer to make different designs for the webpage
        whether the user is seeing the website on a high-resolution screen, or a low-resolution screen. Using this media
        query can provide users with higher-quality images
        on higher resolution screens, and save bandwidth for users on standard displays by showing a lower resolution
        image or hiding the high resolution one all together.

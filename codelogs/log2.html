    <h1 style="text-align:center;">The Difference Between Absolute and Relative CSS Length Units</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Absolute units are for specifying a fixed length value. It doesn't matter what the size of the screen is, the
        value will remain the same.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Relative units aren't fixed. Their values are "relative" to another value, which means that when one value
        changes, the relative unit changes with it. These units depend on other elements for its size, such as the
        parent.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Px/pt, em/rem, and vw/vh in Detail</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Px stands for pixels and is an absolute unit. It's defined as 1/96th of an inch, but isn't an exact pixel for all
        screens. Px can be used to make sure borders look consistent across all screens, and that icons and images stay
        within defined sizing regardless of screen size.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Pt stands for points, which is also an absolute unit. One point is defined as 1/72 of an inch. For screen
        displays, using this length unit is discouraged because screen resolution varies between users, so websites can
        look vastly different depending on the device it's viewed on. However, this length unit is ideal for
        print-specific CSS because it ensures consistent font sizing on paper.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Em units are a relative unit, and is dependant on the computed font-size of the element it's used on, or its
        closest parent element. Em units allow layouts to scale proportionally when the default browser font size
        changes. This unit of measurement ensures consistent design across different screens and devices.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Rem stands for "root em" and is also a relative CSS length unit. This unit's size changes depending on the font
        size of the document's root element. Unlike em, however, the rem unit references a single base size. This unit
        is good for improving accessibility on a website because font size will change depending on a user's browser
        settings.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Vw stands for "viewport width". This is a relative CSS length unit where 1vw would equal 1% of the width of the
        visible screen area of the user. Vw is always relative to the full width of the browser window and scales as the
        user resizes the browser window. This is useful for full-width sections of websites and/or images, as well as
        font size to scale with the screen width.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Vh stands for "viewport height." Similarly to vw, vh is also a relative CSS length unit. However, 1vh equals 1%
        of the height of the browser's screen area. The height of the elements with this unit will scale up and down
        automatically and proportionally when the viewport's height changes. This unit is useful for responsive
        typography and to vertically center content on the webpage.</p>
